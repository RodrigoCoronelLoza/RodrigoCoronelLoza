### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Im a control/robotics engineer. Programming is what I enjoy the most in my career since it constantly challenges my brain to solve all kind of logic problems. I started as a C programmer and the most recent time I have been learning other languages and frameworks specially oriented to the backend web programming.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on websites for music business of accesories and advertising music group services/concerts.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about ReactJs, Express and MySQL/MongoDB.
